 Ask In  /  Tab  \
------------------ 
```
Connect the current page to any LLM running in your tabs. No more copy/pasting grind—just inline answers to the questions you need.

"Ask in Tab" keeps a local record using IndexedDB of the pages where you used it, so your questions and answers will be there when you come back again (unless the page has changed since the last time; you can still export your conversations, though!).

No need to worry about your data since this runs locally, and don’t worry about paying an extra subscription—just download it and use it with the LLMs you’re already paying for.

## Use
