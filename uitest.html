            <h1>The Evolution of Wokeness</h1>
            <p><strong>The word "prig"</strong> isn't very common now, but if you look up the definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:</p>
            <blockquote>A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if superior to others.</blockquote>
            <p>
                This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and its age is an important clue: it shows that although wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an instance of a much older one.
              <span>
                <a href="#"> [0] </a>
              </span>
            </p>

            <div class="companion-response">
              The word "prig" originated in the 16th century and initially meant a thief or petty criminal. By the 17th century, it had evolved to describe a fussy or overly precise person, and by the 18th century, it took on its modern meaning of a self-righteous, moralistic individual who sees themselves as superior.
              Its exact etymology is uncertain, but it may be related to prigge, an old term for a thief, or to the Middle English prikken, meaning "to prick" (suggesting a sense of irritating precision or fussiness).
              The modern sense aligns with longstanding cultural archetypes of moral superiority, showing that the behaviors associated with "wokeness" (or any form of moral posturing) are not new but rather part of a repeating historical pattern.

            <p>
                There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a shallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates his purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every society has these people. All that changes is the rules they enforce. In Victorian England, it was Christian virtue. In Stalin's Russia, it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the woke, it's social justice.
            </p>
            <div class="custom-selection">
            <p>
                So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask is not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs. The question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about these ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to ask when and where wokeness began.
            </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a second, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which started in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and then returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally peaking after the riots of 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was not the original meaning of woke, but it's rarely used in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is the dominant one. What does it mean now? I've often been asked to define both wokeness and political correctness by people who think they're meaningless labels, so I will. They both have the same definition:
            </p>
            <blockquote><strong>An aggressively performative focus on social justice.</strong></blockquote>
            <p>
                In other words, it's people being prigs about social justice. And that's the real problem â€” the performativeness, not the social justice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on the scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one. I don't think any reasonable person would deny that. The problem with political correctness was not that it focused on marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in which it did so. Instead of going out into the world and quietly helping members of marginalized groups, the politically correct focused on getting people in trouble for using the wrong words to talk about them.
